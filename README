Info
====

Run 'sh bootstrap' first if starting with a fresh checkout.


General
=======

./configure
make

With a local Timbl installation:

./configure --prefix=/home/pberck/local --with-timbl=/home/pberck/local
make
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/pberck/local/lib

If Timbl has been installed system-wide, the configure script should be
able to find it without the --with-timbl invocation.

Timbl support can be explicitly disabled by specifying --without-timbl. You 
will be left with a Wopr which can create data sets and run an n-gram
language mode.

OS X
====

./configure --with-timbl=/Users/pberck/install/

Debian 
======

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

seems to be needed when the libraries are installed in the default
place. If not, the following is needed (with the correct path filled
in):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/pberck/local/lib
