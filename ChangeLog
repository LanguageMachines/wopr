1.10.23 Saves gc stats in lcontext.
	MRR calculations (in progress, not used yet).
	
1.10.22	Wopr will now abort pplx_simple if Timbl classify returns null for
	the distribution.
	hapax function now checks if file already exists.
	P(0) caclulation checks for division by 0.
	
1.10.21	I broke down and put the Timbl settings in the ibase filename. It
	does not make pretty filenames (okay, it makes ugly ones), but
	useful. Also took out the id: string from the ibase filename!
	
1.10.20 Removed some debugging output.
	
1.10.19 Default gcd to 50.
	gc_sep became a boolean parameter in lcontext. Default is gc_sep:1
	which means spaces between the binary features. gc_sep:0 means no
	spaces. 
	Fixed a typo in ChangeLog :-)
	
1.10.18 Binary GC type implemented. First version, could be bugs.
	Added type (gct) to auto-filename generation in lcontext.
	
1.10.17 count_lines reinstated.
	Small fixes, improvements.
	
1.10.16 Working lcontext and rfl
