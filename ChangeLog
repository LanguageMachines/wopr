1.14.13	Added weight parameter to Classifiers for 'md' and
	'md2'. Implemented combined distribution in 'md2'.
	
1.14.12	Small fixes in md2 output and md2 file output.
	
1.14.11 Fixed extra output line in 'md2'.
	
1.14.10	Renamed multi_dist2 output .md2. Added example_md.pl script.
	
1.14.9	Moved open_file() outside init() in Classifier.h
	
1.14.8	Added file output to multi_dist2.
	
1.14.7	Added counters to Classifier. ''Work on md2''.
	
1.14.6	Added 'md2', new code in multi_dist2, changes for md2 in
	Classifier.h.
	
1.14.5	Added 'id' parameter to 'md'.
	
1.14.4	Added score per classifier in 'md'.
	
1.14.3	Better file output in 'md'.
	
1.14.2	Fixes, changed multi_distr to use probabilities. Added file output.
	
1.14.1	Added multi_dist function in wex.cc, called 'md' in command
	line. Miscellaneous changes in runrunrun.cc
	
1.14.0	Added wex.cc/h. 
	
1.13.11	Added sentence printout in pplxs. The parameter is "is:" ("include
	sentence"). Value is '1' or '0'.
	
1.13.10	Added file-exists check in ngl.
	
1.13.9	Set "fco" parameter in ngl to default 0.
	Disallow negative "to" parameter in window_lr.
	Function ngl now sets "ngl" prameter instead of "filename".
	Changed "filename" parameter to "testfile" in ngt for consistency.
	
1.13.8	Added forgotten math.h
	
1.13.7	Added id parameter to ngt.
	Added a target offset parameter called "to" to window_lr which
	allows one to skip to the next target. In other words, with
	"to:1" one predicts the word after the next word.
	
1.13.6	Added rudimentary frequency filtering to ngl.
	
1.13.5	Added Turing estimator for unknown words. Uses counts file
	to calculate.
	
1.13.4	Changed ngl output format. Added raw frequencies.
	
1.13.3	File output in ngram output. The ngt functions writes two
	output files; one with a probability per word, and one
	with sentence perplexities. Still to fix: snoothing &c.
	
1.13.2	Entropy and perplexity calculations added.
	
1.13.1	Pure ngram LM code working. Not ready for prime time yet.
	
1.13.0	Moved ngl to own source file.
	
1.12.5	Added probability calculations to ngl.
	
1.12.4	ngl (ngram lists) added.
	
1.12.3	Finished gt function. Changes in man page, which was really out
	of date. Should be rewritten.
	
1.12.2	Added 'gt' (general test) function. Still in beta, do not use yet.
	
1.12.1	Added web/generator/generator.script
	
1.12.0	Added tr function
	
1.11.4	Added id to hapax function (useful for testset)
	
1.11.3	Added fco parameter in focus.
	
1.11.2	Removed excess printing from pplxs.
	
1.11.1	Changes in date_time_stamp in scripts.
	
1.11.0	First version with focus.
	Added "add: filename:.txt" to scripting.
	Added $datetime, $date and $time to kv pairs for scripts.
	
1.10.23 Saves gc stats in lcontext.
	MRR calculations (in progress, not used yet).
	
1.10.22	Wopr will now abort pplx_simple if Timbl classify returns null for
	the distribution.
	hapax function now checks if file already exists.
	P(0) caclulation checks for division by 0.
	
1.10.21	I broke down and put the Timbl settings in the ibase filename. It
	does not make pretty filenames (okay, it makes ugly ones), but
	useful. Also took out the id: string from the ibase filename!
	
1.10.20 Removed some debugging output.
	
1.10.19 Default gcd to 50.
	gc_sep became a boolean parameter in lcontext. Default is gc_sep:1
	which means spaces between the binary features. gc_sep:0 means no
	spaces. 
	Fixed a typo in ChangeLog :-)
	
1.10.18 Binary GC type implemented. First version, could be bugs.
	Added type (gct) to auto-filename generation in lcontext.
	
1.10.17 count_lines reinstated.
	Small fixes, improvements.
	
1.10.16 Working lcontext and rfl
